# Flappy Bird

## Project Overview
Flappy Bird is an endless runner game where players control a bird, guiding it through obstacles by tapping or pressing a key to make it "flap" and avoid hitting pipes. The objective is to achieve the highest score by passing as many obstacles as possible without crashing. This project is implemented using [mention the language or framework, e.g., Dart and Flutter].

## Features
- **Responsive Controls**: Tap or press to make the bird flap, navigating it through gaps in pipes.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the playerâ€™s score, counting each obstacle successfully passed.
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Pipes move across the screen, generating random gaps to increase difficulty.
- **Game Restart**: Players can restart the game after each session to try and beat their previous score.

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game**: Launch the game to see the bird ready to flap.
2. **Control the Bird**: Tap the screen (or press the assigned key) to make the bird flap and stay airborne.
3. **Avoid Obstacles**: Pass through gaps in the pipes to earn points.
4. **Game Over**: The game ends if the bird hits a pipe or the ground.
